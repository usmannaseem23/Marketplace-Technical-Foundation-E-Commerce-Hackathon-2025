### Component Descriptions
- **Frontend (Next.js)**:
  - Provides a responsive and interactive user interface for browsing products, managing orders, and handling user authentication.
  - Fetches and displays data from the backend APIs in real-time.

- **Sanity CMS**:
  - Centralized backend for managing product information, user data, order records, and inventory.
  - Exposes APIs for dynamic data communication with the frontend.

- **Third-Party APIs**:
  1. **Shipment Tracking API (ShipEngine)**: Fetches real-time shipping updates and generates tracking details.
  2. **Payment Gateway (Stripe)**: Processes secure transactions and confirms payment status.

- **Authentication (Clerk)**:
  - Handles user registration, login, and session management.
  - Integrates with Sanity CMS to store user data securely.

---

## Key Workflows

### 1. User Registration
- **Process**:
  - User signs up via the frontend using Clerk.
  - Registration details are stored in Sanity CMS.

### 2. Product Browsing
- **Process**:
  - User navigates through product categories on the frontend.
  - Sanity CMS API fetches product data (name, price, stock, description, images).
  - Dynamic product listings are displayed on the frontend.

### 3. Order Placement
- **Process**:
  - User adds products to the cart and proceeds to checkout.
  - Order details (products, quantities, shipping address) are sent to Sanity CMS.
  - Payment is processed via Stripe.
  - A confirmation message is sent to the user's email, and the order is recorded in Sanity CMS.

### 4. Shipment Tracking
- **Process**:
  - After order placement, shipment details are updated using ShipEngine.
  - Real-time tracking information is displayed to the user on the frontend.

### 5. Inventory Management
- **Process**:
  - Product stock levels are managed in Sanity CMS.
  - Real-time stock updates are fetched from Sanity CMS.
  - Out-of-stock products are added to the wishlist instead of the cart.
  - In-stock products can be added to the cart and proceed to checkout.
